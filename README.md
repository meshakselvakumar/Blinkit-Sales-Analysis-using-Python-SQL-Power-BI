🚀 End-to-End Data Analytics Project | Blinkit Sales Analysis using Python, SQL & Power BI 💻📊
Over the past few weeks, I worked on an exciting Data Analytics project focused on analyzing the Blinkit Sales Dataset — transforming raw data into actionable business insights through Python, MySQL, and Power BI.
This project helped me gain a holistic understanding of how real-world business data can be processed, analyzed, and visualized to support data-driven decisions.

🐍 Python (Blinkit.ipynb)
The first step was handling the raw dataset using Python. I began by importing, cleaning, and transforming data using Pandas and NumPy. Handling missing values, formatting data types, and ensuring accuracy were essential before diving into analysis.
Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify sales trends and correlations. Some key steps included:
1.Visualizing Total Sales distribution across different outlet sizes and item types.
2.Analyzing sales trends by location type and outlet establishment year.
3.Exploring which product categories and outlet types contributed most to total revenue.

This stage revealed patterns that highlighted the influence of outlet size and item visibility on sales performance — providing a foundation for the next steps.

🧮 SQL 
(KPY Card.sql)
After cleaning and exploring data in Python, I used MySQL to compute key performance indicators (KPIs).
I designed and executed SQL queries to calculate:
💰 Total Sales (converted into millions for better readability)
📊 Average Sales per Outlet
🏪 Sales grouped by Outlet Size and Item Type

(Charts.sql)
1.Total Sales by Fat Content
2.Total Sales by Item Type  
3.Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales
4.Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales
5.Percentage of Sales by Outlet Size
6.Sales by Outlet Location 
7.All Metrics by Outlet Type 

Each query provided structured insights that connected business metrics to the analytical findings from Python. I also optimized queries for better performance and accuracy by using aggregate functions, data casting, and grouping operations.
This process gave me hands-on experience in relational database querying and data validation — essential for ensuring consistency across multiple analysis tools.

📈 Power BI (Blinkit.pbix)
Once the core insights were extracted, I visualized them using Power BI.
I built a fully interactive dashboard that brings together all key KPIs and visual trends in one place.
 The dashboard highlights:
1.Total and Average Sales performance
2.Outlet Size and Location-based comparisons
3.Product-level insights and category-wise revenue
4.Time-based analysis of sales performance

The Power BI visuals made it easy to communicate data stories in a clear and impactful way, turning numbers into actionable business insights for stakeholders.

💡 Key Learnings & Outcomes
✔ Learned how to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world data end-to-end.
 ✔ Improved my SQL query-building skills for business KPIs.
 ✔ Strengthened my Python EDA and data visualization expertise.
 ✔ Developed Power BI dashboards that present analytical results clearly.
 ✔ Understood how each tool complements the other — from raw data to insights.

This project was a great way to bring together technical skills and business understanding — showcasing the full data analytics lifecycle:
